        <h3 id="dear">Dear Jayelyn,</h3>
        <p id="letter">I can still remember the first time we met. August 2008, at volleyball tryout. No one knows but I actaully didn't want
          to come to tryout at all but I'm so glad that I did. To be fair, we also met a couple of other cool people but they're irrelevant right now!
          I get really excited when you talk about your first impressions of me. "The young, innocent Asian girl" and "You came 3 hours late" are a few
          of my favorites then it's usually follows by, "But look at you now" and "WOW, I was so wrong". Good news is that it only took you 9 years to realized it.
      </p>
      <p id="letter">There were so much that happened in high school. The after school practices,  the movies, and I guess we did some homework too.
        It's predictable to say that my favorite was senior year. Not only because of the off-campus lunches but it was the year that we got to run
        NAHS together. I don't know why, but I really miss those days. That was also the year that we got caught cheating...in driving school. That was
        when I learned that getting trouble could be fun too. My highschool time would've suck a lot with you and all the trouble we got in. I would probably
        still be that navive Asian girl that study all the time. Thank you for putting up with my loud burps, my sarcasmtic jokes and many other things
        that other people would have walk away from on day one.
      </p>
      <p id="letter">I'm going to jump pass the "wonderful" years at UT because I can talk about it all day. There was the one year where we didn't talk because
        we were both busy. And there was the one Summer that we now call "The Best Summber Ever". But this year, when you moved to Houston and left me here,
        we slowly got back talking about Scandal, HTGAWM and Empire, and we talked a whole lot about life which is so suprising to me. I never thought
        it would be so easy to pick up a conversation with anyone after months of nothing. But we didn't just pick up a conversation, we picked up our
        friendship which I now believe is that much stronger. Thank you so much for reminding me what it takes to be a friend and the meaning of friendship.
      </p>
      <p id="letter">The fun is still there, the love is still there and now, we starting that "adult life" that everyone warns us about. I'm so lucky to
        have you in my life. Everything happens for a reason and when people say "Dinh, you're so awesome" (yes people actually say that to me!), I will tell
        to thank my friend Jayelyn, I wouldn't half as cool if it wasn't for you. You were the one that gave me my "black" card which you have taken it back
        for some reason. But I'm not mad about it. Really, I'm not! Anyway, I can't wait for the next chapter of our friendship. I'm so excited for the
        Toronto trip this January and we are going to have many many more of those drinks that got you tipsy too quickly.
      </p>
      <p id="letter">Thank you for always being my Olivia Pope. Love you lots.
