          Who would have thought that an innocent girl from Edcuador could make such an impact on my life? It was the Spring of 2013, after our
        CS311 that you came up to me, introduced yourself and proposed that we become studying buddies. It all started with "Hi, I'm Paola". Those three
        words were the start an amazing friendship. Those three words were the start of a journey that I wasn't ready for but oh boy I'm so glad I got on.
        I didn't care for it back then, but somehow we became roommates. This is probably my favorite story to tell people about our friendship (Yes, I know it's yours too).
        Honestly, looking back, I love that time we spent not being close to each other even though we literally slept in the same room, shared the same bathroom and "studied"
        right next to each other everyday. The reason why I said that is because it gave the chance to watch you be you. There were no pressure of us being around each other,
        it just worked and it was so easy. I'm going to skip over a lot of the fun times because I don't, I will start crying again. Oh, yep, tears, again.

        ANYWAY, you've thanked me on many occations that I introduced you to the craft beers, the rock climbing and how to "social drink", but I don't think you realize that
        I owe you so much for showing me what it takes to be a friend and what it means to be happy. You are one of the strongest and most competetive people I've met in my life.
        Thank you for always pushing me, thank you for always put me back in check and thank you for always being there. You are my Wonder Woman!

        I still don't know why you came up to say hi to me that day after class but I'm so glad you did. I'm so happy to have been there with you through this first chapter of your career.
        It sucks that we didn't get a proper goodbye so maybe this isn't the end.
        This is the new beginning to your second chapter and bet your ass that I will be there. But for now, every boulder I climb, I will think "WWPD" (What would Paola Do?) because...well,
        I'm sure you know why.

        Not all of the tears are of sadness. Now, you get to go show San Diego that Wonder Woman mentality and be that awesome person that I admire so much. Just remember that I am only a phone call and 3 hour flight away.
        Until we reunite again, go drink the beers and have all the fun for the two of us. And yes, you will always be the Grace to my Frankie.
